Algorithm: Prediction
  Input:
    - u: A user
    - i: An item
    - n: The network for the current user
    - R: The ratings matrix
    - M: The set of trained modeling methods
  Do
    1. Collect predictions from each method in M for (u,i)
    2. Set the network inputs to the method outputs
    3. Run the network with these inputs
    4. Return the network output
  End
