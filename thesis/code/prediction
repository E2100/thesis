Algorithm: Prediction
  Input:
    - u: A user
    - i: An item
    - M: The set of trained modeling methods
    - S: The set of MetaSVD methods
  Do
    1. Collect predictions from each method in M for (u,i)
    2. Estimate errors for each method for (u,i)
    3. Create a weighted combination of the predictions and weights
    4. Return the combined prediction
  End
