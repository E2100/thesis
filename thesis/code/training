Algorithm: Training
  Input:
    - R: The ratings matrix
    - U: The set of users
    - M: The set of modeling methods
  Do
    1. For each method in M:
       1. Take new bootstrap sample from R
       2. Train method with this sample
    2. For each user in U:
       1. Select all known user ratings from R
       2. Collect predictions from trained methods for these items
       3. Create training examples from method outputs and known ratings
       4. Train a new MP with these examples
    3. Return
       1. The trained methods
       2. The trained networks
  End
