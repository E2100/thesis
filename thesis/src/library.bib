@inproceedings{Chirita2010,
abstract = {Information overload occurs when an application presents more information than a user is able to consume. This problem is especially visible on the World Wide Web, where the sheer wealth and scope of information quickly strains the user experience. The problem becomes even more prominent in ap- plications designed to aggregate content from dif- ferent sources. Whether the content is written by multiple authors, pertain to varying topics, or is of fluctuating quality, presenting this content in a co- herent and interesting way to each individual user is a major challenge. This paper looks at how adaptive content can help mitigate the problem of information overload in content aggregating web applications. Our tool for the job is user modeling — methods in Artificial In- telligence (ai) that create digital representations of users, so that content may be adapted on a personal level. Specifically, this paper explores the field of recom- mender systems. These are methods designed to estimate just how interesting items of some sort will be to each user. Our survey will investigate the most prominent and novel approaches to user modeling, in the context of improving the content displayed by an online feed reader. We explore the inferential competence, provided features, and the consequences for the user interface of each model- ing method. The result is a thorough exploration of what user modeling means for the Web.},
