\vspace{1em}

Study how to aggregate user models on a per-user and per-item
basis when combining results from complementing modeling algorithms.

Create a flexible algorithm that combines multiple predictions
into one coherent result.
Utilize the resulting aggregation algorithm
to provide personalized search in an information retrieval system.
