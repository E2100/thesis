  Preface\\

\vspace{2em}

This is a Master Thesis in the field of Artificial Intelligence,
as part of my degree in Computer Science
at the Norwegian University of Science and Technology (NTNU).
My specialization is in the field of intelligent systems, 
at the Department of Computer and Information Science (IDI), 
faculty of Information Technology, Mathematics and Electrical Engineering (IME).

I would like to thank my supervisor, assistant professor Asbjørn Thomassen, for valuable guidance and feedback throughout the process.
In addition, thanks are in order for my fellow students 
Kim Joar Bekkelund, Kjetil Valle and Magne Matre Gåsland,
who helped me formulate my thoughts and provided feedback on the work represented by this document.

To limit the scope of an already extensive topic, this document assumes a basic knowledge of set theory, 
linear algebra, graph theory and fundamental concepts in artificial intelligence on behalf of the reader.
