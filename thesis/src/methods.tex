\label{chap:methods}

In this chapter, we will build our approach to user modeling.
We will first explain why a new approach is needed,
and then develop our own model.
The last parts of this chapter shows how this new approach
can perform prediction aggregation in a recommendation scenario,
and rank aggregation in an information retrieval scenario.

In this chapter, we have seen how to create stacked recommenders.
It is now time to see how this model performs.
The next chapter will test the viability of this model
through a number of hypotheses.
