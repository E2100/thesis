This chapter will build our approach to user modeling.
We will first explain why a new approach is needed,
and outline a few hypotheses that will test our reasoning.
We shall then develop \emph{stacked user modeling},
a novel approach to adaptive user model aggregation.
The last parts of this chapter shows how this new approach
can perform prediction aggregation in a recommendation scenario,
and rank aggregation in an information retrieval scenario.
