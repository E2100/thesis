In this chapter we will build our approach to user modeling:
blending multiple predictors on per-user basis.
We will first explain the reasoning behind our hypotheses,
before we present a method for personalized aggregation.

These personalized \emph{meta models} are then used to perform prediction aggregation in a recommendation scenario,
and rank aggregation in an information retrieval scenario.
%Chapter \ref{chap:results} will experiment with these solutions,
%before we discuss and draw conclusions in the final chapter.
