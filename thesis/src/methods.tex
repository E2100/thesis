This chapter will build our approach to user modeling.
We will first explain why a new approach is needed,
and outline a few hypotheses that will test our reasoning.
We shall then develop \emph{stacked user modeling},
a novel approach to adaptive user model aggregation.
The last parts of this chapter shows how this new approach
can perform prediction aggregation in a recommendation scenario,
and rank aggregation in an information retrieval scenario.

In this chapter, we have seen how to perform stacked user modeling.
It is now time to see how this model performs.
The next chapter will test the viability of 
our model and answer our three hypotheses.
