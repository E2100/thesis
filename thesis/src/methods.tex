\label{chap:methods}

In this chapter we will build our approach to user modeling, which we call \emph{adaptive recommenders}.
We will first explain why a new approach is needed, and develop three hypotheses based on our assumptions.
The two final sections will show how \emph{adaptive recommenders}
can perform prediction aggregation (combining scores) in a recommendation scenario,
and rank aggregation (combining sorted lists) in a personalized search scenario.

%Now that we have our model,
%it is time to see how it performs.

%In this chapter, we have seen how to create adaptive recommenders.
%It is now time to see how this model performs.
%The next chapter will test the viability of this model
%by testing our three hypotheses.
