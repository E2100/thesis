\label{chap:methods}

In this chapter, we will build our approach to user modeling.
We will first explain why a new approach is needed,
and develop three hypotheses based on the 
assumptions in Chapter \ref{chap:intro}.
The two final sections will show how \emph{stacked recommenders}
can perform prediction aggregation in a recommendation scenario,
and rank aggregation in an information retrieval scenario.

In this chapter, we have seen how to create stacked recommenders.
It is now time to see how this model performs.
The next chapter will test the viability of this model
by testing our three hypotheses.
