In this chapter we shall build our approach to user modeling.
We will first explain the reasoning behind our hypotheses,
before developing an approach to adaptive aggregation,
called \emph{stacked user modeling}.
We will then show how to use these \emph{meta models}
to perform prediction aggregation in a recommendation scenario,
and rank aggregation in an information retrieval scenario.
The performance of our method will be tested in the next chapter.
