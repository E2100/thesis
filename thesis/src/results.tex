\label{chap:results}

This chapter will perfom experiments to find out whether or not
\emph{stacked user modeling} is a viable technique.
We will first explain which evaluation metrics will be used,
and the datasets we will use to test the technique.
Then, we will test each of hypotheses given in Section \ref{sec:hypotheses}.
The next chapter will discuss the implications of these results.

In this chapter, we have seen what stacked user modeling is capable of.
We confirmed hypotheses H1 and H2 by showing that this technique
can outperform both standard recommender systems and 
simple aggregation methods. As seen in the previous section,
H3 was confirmed by showing how stacked user modeling can provide
personalized search together with an IR model.
The next chapter will discuss these findings and their respective implications.
