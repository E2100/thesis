\label{chap:results}

This chapter will perfom experiments to find out whether or not
\emph{stacked recommenders} is a viable technique.
We will test our three hypotheses based on the assumption in Chapters 
\ref{chap:intro} \emph{\&} \ref{chap:methods}.
We will then explain which evaluation metrics will be used,
the datasets we will use to test the technique,
and test each hypothesis.
The next chapter will discuss the implications of these results.

%In this chapter, we have seen what stacked recommenders are capable of.
%We confirmed hypotheses H1 and H2 by showing that this technique
%can outperform both standard recommender systems and 
%simple aggregation methods. As seen in the previous section,
%H3 was confirmed by showing how stacked recommenders can provide
%personalized search together with an IR model.
%The next chapter will discuss these findings and their respective implications.
