\label{chap:results}

This chapter will perfom experiments to find out whether or not
\emph{stacked recommenders} is a viable technique.
We will perform three experiments to 
test the three hypotheses outlined in Section 
\ref{sec:hypotheses}.
The next chapter will discuss implications 
and limitations of the results.

%In this chapter, we have seen what stacked recommenders are capable of.
%We confirmed hypotheses H1 and H2 by showing that this technique
%can outperform both standard recommender systems and 
%simple aggregation methods. As seen in the previous section,
%H3 was confirmed by showing how stacked recommenders can provide
%personalized search together with an IR model.
%The next chapter will discuss these findings and their respective implications.
