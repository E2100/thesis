Algorithm: Training
  Input:
    - R: The ratings matrix
    - M: The set of modeling methods
  Do
    1. For each method in M:
       1. Take new bootstrap sample from R
       2. Train method with this sample
       3. Train a MetaSVD for this method
    2. Return
       1. The trained methods
       2. The trained meta methods
