\chapter*{Abstract}

Modern recommender systems blend multiple standard recommenders
in order to leverage disjoint patterns in the available data.

This paper presents a novel method for adaptive prediction aggregation.
Multiple recommenders are combined on a per-user and per-item basis
by estimating how accurate each recommender will be for the current user and item.
This is done by creating a set of secondary error estimating recommenders.

Prediction aggreation is tested in a recommendations scenario,
and rank aggregation in a personalized search scenario.
Our initial results are promising, showing that stacked recommenders
can outperform both standard recommenders and simple aggregation methods.
