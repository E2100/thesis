\cite[p1]{Joachims2007}: How users evaluate SERPs:
"This paper examines the reliability of implicit feedback generated from clickthrough data and query reformulations in WWW search. Analyzing the usersâ€™ decision process using eyetracking and comparing implicit feedback against manual relevance judgments, we conclude that clicks are informative but biased. While this makes the interpretation of clicks as absolute relevance judgments difficult, we show that relative preferences derived from clicks are reasonably accurate on average. We find that such relative preferences are accurate not only between results from an individual query, but across multiple sets of results within chains of query reformulations."
