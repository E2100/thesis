\label{chap:theory}

This chapter will introduce some basic theory needed to develop our approach to user modeling.
We will first describe our stated enemy, the information overload problem, before delving into
how user modeling and, more specifically, recommender systems, is currently used to solve this problem.
This chapter will also introduce the notion of personalized search, a field where
our user modeling method will be especially applicable.

This chapter has introduced the basic theory we will need to develop our take on user modeling.
The next chapter will build this model,
While Chapter \ref{chap:results} presents our evaluation experiments.
