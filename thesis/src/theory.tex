This chapter will introduce some basic theory needed to develop our approach to user modeling.
We will first describe our stated enemy, the information overload problem, before delving into
how user modeling and, more specifically, recommender systems, is currently used to solve this problem.

This chapter will also introduce the notion of personalized search, a field where
our user modeling method will be especially applicable.
The next chapter will use these theories to build an \emph{even more personalized approach} to user modeling.
