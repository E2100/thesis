\label{chap:theory}

This chapter will introduce previous work and background theory needed to develop our approach.
We will first describe the information overload problem, before delving into
how user modeling and recommender systems are currently used to solve this problem.
This chapter will also introduce the field of personalized search, 
where our adaptive recommenders will be especially applicable.

%This chapter has introduced the previous work and background theory we will need to develop our take on user modeling.
%The next chapter will first explain why a new approach is needed, and outline three hypotheses.
%We shall then build our model.
%Chapter \ref{chap:results} will experiment with this model to evaluate its viability.
