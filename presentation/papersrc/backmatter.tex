\section{Conclusion}
\label{sec:conclusion}

This paper has described the \emph{latent subjectivity problem}
and why we believe this is a fundamental issue
with many recommender systems.
\emph{Adaptive Recommenders} is our 
attempt at a solution.
By adaptively choosing which algorithms are employed
based on the current context,
truly adaptive systems can be created.
Our initial results show that this approach
can outperform standard recommenders
and simple aggregation approaches.
While our tests show the basic viability of our approach,
more testing against complex aggregation functions
is still required.
